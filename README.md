- Lesson 1

### Installation

To get started with react-three-fiber using Vite, follow these steps:

` npm create vite my-app `

Select React as the framework.

` cd my-app `
` npm install three @react-three/fiber `

Start Development Server

` npm run dev `

After setting up the project, you can start creating and exploring 3D scenes using **react-three-fiber**. 

### Introduction

This repository documents the process of learning react-three-fiber, a React renderer for three.js. We start with a basic scene and gradually incorporate more advanced features and helper functions provided by react-three-drei

### Lesson 1

In Lesson 1, we learned how to implement three.js in React using react-three-fiber and react-three. We recreated the basic scene from the template and added orbital controls, similar to what we did in native JavaScript.

### Template

The template contains a boilerplate project with a basic scene, including sphere, box, and plane geometry. Initially, this scene does not include orbital controls.

### Drei

In the Drei Directory, we explored react-three-drei, a collection of helpful pre-written helper functions for react-three-fiber. These utilities simplify common tasks and enhance the development experience.

To install react drei in the project use this command: `npm install @react-three/drei`
